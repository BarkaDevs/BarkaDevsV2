        <h2 class="sub-title">(where did it all start)</h2>
        <p>
          BarkaDevs started as a group of IT students at SEAIT, led by Keyan
          Andy Delgado. Brought together by a shared passion for web
          development, we decided to team up and call ourselves BarkaDevs. What
          began as late-night problem-solving sessions and brainstorming ideas
          turned into a team focused on building real-world digital solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take pride in turning code into functional, meaningful websites.
          Guided by Keyan, we value teamwork, innovation, and the joy of
          creating impactful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than just a team, BarkaDevs is a community built on shared growth
          and a passion for technology. We thrive on collaboration and embrace
          the challenges of web development, always striving to make technology
          work for people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining BarkaDevs means being part of a story of continuous learning,
          creativity, and purpose-driven development.
